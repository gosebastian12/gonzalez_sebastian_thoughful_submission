# Thoughtful AI Challenge Submission - Sebastian Gonzalez
The main design of this solution hinges on a line-by-line reading of a file-system-accessible `.txt` file using the built-in Python `open()` function and the ability to iterate over each lines in a simple `for` loop. W/this iterative line reading, the only content saved in-memory are all of the transactions found for a unique `claim_id`. Those stored claim-specific transactions are then passed to a `is_cycle` custom function that checks for all of the specified cycle-contraints.

The feasability of this approach is reliant on the `.txt` file being pre-sorted. That is, the ordering of the transactions for a `claim_id` is specified by the ordering of the lines in the file AND all of those claim transactions are found in the same section of the file. These assumptions were made because there were no timestamp values given. Additionally, it seemed plausable for a Data Engineering pipeline/process generating such a `.txt` file to ensure such ordering. Future improvements could center on enabling the approach to work when transactions for a `claim_id` are scattered randomly throughout the contents of the `.txt` file.

Of note is that the script only takes around 30 to 60 seconds to complete for the GCloud-provided `large_input_v1.txt` file. This is part because once all cycles are identified, a Pandas-written array based approach is used to quickly find the longest one.

Additional assumptions to higlight are:
1. If there is an intermediate transaction with a `destination_system` that matches the original `source_system`, *but* the **final** `destination_system` is different, the chain of transactions is NOT a cycle.
2. Any repeated lines in a chain of claim-specific transactions between the start and ending means it is NOT a cycle.
3. The script should work when the local path to the file is specified as a cmd-line-argument *or* when the public Google Drive link is.
    * The latter results in the `.txt` file getting downloaded onto the file system of the runtime env.
4. If there are any pair of consecutive transactions for a `claim_id` where the `destination_system` of the first does *not* match the `source_system` of the second, the entire chain is deemed to NOT be a cycle. This is to enfore the "directional edges" constraint.

# Notes on Executing Script
Because the solution-script hinges on the `pandas` and `gdown` Open-Source libraries, a `requirements.txt` file is provided. The recommended approach is to instantiate a fresh Python virtual environemnt and run a `pip install` command using this file. Alternanatively, a simple `pip install pandas, gdown` command should work as well.
